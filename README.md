MemimageAnalyser for Volatility2

A tool to automate some of the initial triage of forensics memory image evidences.

It is written in Python 3.7 and requires Volatility 2.6.1+.

The tool was inspired by several great tutorials and trainings, few of them is listed below.
Without understanding the background, the tool is not big of a help, so I recommend doing the trianings first
 if you are not familiar with memory analysis at all.
